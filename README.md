# Password Credentials Token Source
A golang.org/x/oauth2 client for the passwordcredentials OAuth 2.0 flow.

This package is extracted from https://github.com/golang/oauth2/issues/186. When the `passwordcredentials` token source is included in the standard library, this package will be archived and you should switch to use the standard library implementation.
